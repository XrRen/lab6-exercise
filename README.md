## What the software does
The first part of the DoSomething notebook was written by Xirui Ren. It will ask for the user's name, age, and how they feel today. Depending on the different age entered and the feeling entered, it will print out one of three possible responses. The second part of this notbook was written by Emily Durning. It asks for the user's name and asks what year they were born and what month. It will then tell the user how old they are.
